Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes for patients, but detection can be challenging. This project aims to explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the automated detection of Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI images.
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which are a type of deep neural network that has proven to be highly effective for image classification tasks.

## Dataset
The Dataset consists of Preprocessed MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) Images. 
All the images are resized into 128 x 128 pixels.</br>
The Dataset consists of a total of 6400 MRI images with four classes</br>
- Mild Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Moderate Demented
- Very Mild Demented

## CNN Models
Several different CNN architectures were trained and evaluated for this task, including VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and EfficeintNetB0. Hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs were tuned to optimize performance on the task.
