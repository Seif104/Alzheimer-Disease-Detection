Alzheimer's disease is a type of dementia that affects millions of people worldwide. Early diagnosis and treatment can improve outcomes for patients, but detection can be challenging. This project aims to explore the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for the automated detection of Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI images.
